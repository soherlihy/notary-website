# Stephen O’Herlihy — Notary Public (Website)

This repo contains a single page website (`index.html`). It works on **GitHub Pages**.

## How to publish on GitHub Pages (no coding)
1. Go to https://github.com and log in (create a free account if needed).
2. Click **+** (top-right) → **New repository**.
3. Name it something like `notary-website` (Public is fine). Leave other settings as-is. Click **Create repository**.
4. On the new repo page, click **Add file → Upload files**.
5. Drag-and-drop the two files from this ZIP: `index.html` and `README.md`. Click **Commit changes**.
6. Enable **GitHub Pages**: go to **Settings** → **Pages** (left sidebar).
7. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
8. Set **Branch** to **main** and the folder to **/** (root), then click **Save**.
9. Wait ~1 minute. A public link (something like `https://yourname.github.io/notary-website/`) will appear on the Pages screen. Click it to view your site.

## Editing your site
- To change booking/newsletter links, click `index.html` in GitHub → **Edit** (pencil icon) → make changes → **Commit changes**.
- For custom domain later, in **Settings → Pages**, add your domain and follow GitHub's DNS instructions.

If something looks off, open an Issue in the repo or contact your assistant for tweaks.
